[RED VARIATIONS OF THE LIVING]
<br>
<br>
<br>
 The sculpture we’ve been making all my life, the one your hands lay on. I have been working. You have been sleeping. Sleep is an animal that we let go; made the soft surface of my body tired, far away, a lovely dance with the goddess, the fragile distance. 
<br>
 The distance I take for you now is considered. I love, love, love the broken bones in my body. Demonstrate, now, the temporal mechanic called hate — I can’t be expected to bail you out, anymore. I loved with shame, and you killed the shame, so I love endlessly. You never did, so I do it for you.
